                    Steven Paul Jobs was an American inventor, designer and entrepreneur who was the co-founder, chief
                    executive and
                    chairman of Apple Computer. Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod, iPhone and iPad,
                    are now seen as
                    dictating the evolution of modern technology.

                    Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was
                    smart but
                    directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with different pursuits before co-founding
                    Apple with Steve
                    Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left the company in 1985, launching Pixar Animation Studios, then returned to
                    Apple more than a
                    decade later. Jobs died in 2011 following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.

                    California, U.S.—died October 5, 2011,
                    Palo Alto, California), cofounder of Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple Inc.), and a charismatic
                    pioneer of the personal
                    computer era.

                <p>
                    As a boy, Jobs and his father worked on electronics in the family garage. Paul showed his son how to
                    take apart and
                    reconstruct electronics, a hobby that instilled confidence, tenacity and mechanical prowess in young
                    Jobs.

                    Back in Silicon Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with Stephen Wozniak, a former high
                    school friend who was
                    working for the Hewlett-Packard Company. When Wozniak told Jobs of his progress in designing his own
                    computer logic
                    board, Jobs suggested that they go into business together, which they did after Hewlett-Packard
                    formally
                    turned down
                    Wozniak’s design in 1976. The Apple I, as they called the logic board, was built in the Jobses’
                    family
                    garage with money
                    they obtained by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak’s programmable calculator.

                <h3>Founding and Leaving Apple Computer</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1976, when Jobs was just 21, he and Wozniak started Apple Computer in the Jobs’ family garage. They
                    funded their
                    entrepreneurial venture by Jobs selling his Volkswagen bus and Wozniak selling his beloved scientific
                    calculator. Jobs
                    and Wozniak are credited with revolutionizing the computer industry with Apple by democratizing the
                    technology and
                    making machines smaller, cheaper, intuitive and accessible to everyday consumers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wozniak conceived of a series of user-friendly personal computers, and — with Jobs in charge of
                    marketing — Apple
                    initially marketed the computers for $666.66 each. The Apple I earned the corporation around $774,000.
                    Three years after
                    the release of Apple's second model, the Apple II, the company's sales increased by 700 percent to $139
                    million.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1980, Apple Computer became a publicly-traded company, with a market value of $1.2 billion by the end
                    of its very
                    first day of trading. Jobs looked to marketing expert John Sculley of Pepsi-Cola to take over the role
                    of CEO for Apple.
