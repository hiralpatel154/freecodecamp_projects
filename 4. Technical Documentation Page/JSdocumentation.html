            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a
                host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
                environment to provide
                programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements
                such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
                of purposes by
                supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                    its Document Object Model
                    (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML
                    form and respond to user
                    events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                    JavaScript on a server. For
                    example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
                    continuity of information
                    from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <code>
                function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } greetMe("World");
                        
            </code><br>

            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                JavaScript language
                resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
                most Java expression
                syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
                from LiveScript to
                JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                runtime system based
                on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
                prototype-based
                object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
                dynamic
                inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports
                functions without any
                special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
                methods.</p>
            <code>
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 10.50;
            </code><br>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="JS_Output">JS Output</header>
            <p>JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
                <li>Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.</li>
                <li>Writing into the HTML output using document.write().</li>
                <li>Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().</li>
                <li>
                    Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
                </li>
            </p>
            <p><h4>Using innerHTML</h4>
                To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the document.getElementById(id) method.

                The id attribute defines the HTML element. The innerHTML property defines the HTML content: <br><br>
                <code>
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
            </code><br>
                <h4>Using document.write()</h4>
                For testing purposes, it is convenient to use document.write(): <br><br>
                <code>
                document.write(5 + 6);
            </code><br>
                <h4>Using window.alert()</h4>
                <code>
                window.alert(5 + 6);
            </code><br>

                <h4>Using console.log()</h4>
                For debugging purposes, you can call the console.log() method in the browser to display data. <br><br>
                <code>
                console.log(5 + 6);
            </code> <br>
                <h4>JavaScript Print</h4>
                JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods.

                You cannot access output devices from JavaScript.

                The only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the browser to print the
                content of the current
                window. <br><br>
                <code>
                window.print()
            </code>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="Variables">Variables</header>
            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is
                window, so you can set
                and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
            <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or
                frame by specifying
                the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document,
                you can refer to this
                variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
            <code>
                const PI = 3.14;<br><br><br>
                // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5;
                var g; //statements }
            </code><br>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="Scope">Scope</header>
            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
                available to any
                other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a
                local variable,
                because it is available only within that function.</p>
            <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared
                within a block is
                local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                code will log 5,
                because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
                block, which in this case
                is an if statement.</p>
            <code>
                if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
            </code>
